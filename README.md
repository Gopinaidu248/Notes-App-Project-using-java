# Notes-App-Project-using-java
Project Overview  The Java File I/O Notes App is a simple console-based note-taking application that demonstrates how to persist data using files. Unlike programs that lose data when closed, this app allows users to create, save, and retrieve notes permanently by using Javaâ€™s File I/O classes such as FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader.
